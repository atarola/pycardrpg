h2. Card Based Character System

h3. Attributes

The basic abilities a unit has.  There are four types of Attribute:

* Strength: Power a unit has.  This directly relates to damage done by attacks.
* Intelligence: Smarts a unit has.  This limits the number of skills a unit has.
* Dexterity: A unit's nimbleness.  Directly relates to the armor value of the unit.
* Stamina: How well a unit handles fatigue and damage.

From the base attributes, some others are derived:

* Hit Points (HP): The amount of damage a unit can withstand before death.
* Action Points (AP): Points spent in the executing of actions.
