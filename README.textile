h2. Card Based Character System

h3. Attributes

The basic abilities a unit has.

h3. Skills

Skills are task specific aptitudes a unit has, which grant additional Action Cards
to the unit's pool.

h3. Experience Points

Units are awarded Experience Points for defeating enemies and completing tasks
that move them closer to their goal.  These Experience Points can be spent either
on better Attributes, or on Skills.

h3. Equipment Cards

All units in the game, characters and enemies both, have a set of slots that 
*Equipment Cards* can be added too.  These cards, along with the unit's base 
Attributes and Job information, set the basic statistics for the unit, while 
giving the pool of Action Cards for use in the Action Deck.  

Each Equipment Card has specific Attribute and Skill requirements to use.

h3. Action Cards

Each unit will have an Action Deck.  An Action Deck is exactly 40 Action Cards
in size.  The maximum number of a single Action Card that can be in a deck is 
4, except for "Attack" Action Card which can be used in an unlimited fashion.  

Each Action Card cost a specific number of Action Points (AP) to play. 

A unit has 5 Action Cards in its' hand, of which they can play one each turn.
Once that card is played, it is added to the Discard Pile.  If, at the end of
a turn, the unit's hand is less than 5, another card is added to the hand from 
the unused Action Deck.  

When the Action Deck is empty, the cards in the Discard Pile are shuffled and 
put into the Action Deck.
